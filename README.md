# Clustering_Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation 
The data used in this kernel is the 'Mall Customer Segmentation Data' of Kaggle. 
The fields in the dataset are: ID of customer, age, gender, income and spending score. This last concept, spending score, is the one we will be focused on.
We want to determine hidden patterns in our data that help us to increase the 'spending score' of our customers. So the hidden patterns found have to be related to the 'spending score' field.
With clustering we can improve the objectives of our marketing strategies, and we can reach our target with much more personalized strategies that will make the performance of the campaigns greater.
